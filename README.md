# project-one

The challenge of this project is how to make Mario run smoothly. In my case, I first tried using 3classes to contain, remove and add, and the result was not as great as I expected.
Because I had ten cells for each row, I had one more Mario that would appear than I planted. To fix my problem, I had to change the way to approach this problem. In the end, I used four different array prototypes (slice, filter, map, forEach)to help me solve this problem instead of making ten classes. A ternary operator also played a big part in my function. It is not easy for me to combine all those methods in my process. I spent a long time selecting the right element and using the correct syntax. 
I was reading how to create a grid that helped me to make my obstacles. I had my drawing to help me visualize how my frog moves. In my losseLife function, I struggled to include all the characters in the function by using a simple ().
