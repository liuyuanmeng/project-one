                                    Project One - Frog vs Mario

Frog vs Mario is a game based on the game called Frogger. The player must avoid falling into the water and getting hit by the obstacles to win. In Frog vs Mario, the player has six chances to reach the finish line. Different Mario characters are set at different speeds to stop the user from getting to the finish line. The player can choose to play a new game after reaching the finish line.
